# ML-Models-on-Datasets
Collection of machine learning projects created using scikit-learn, PyTorch, or implemented from scratch in NumPy. All projects are original, built from the ground up based on my own understanding. No tutorials were used, these are genuine implementations to deepen my grasp of ML concepts. All projects were created as I learned, so a few include less practical decisions, like evaluating an imbalanced classification problem using only accuracy.

# Top Projects
These are projects I am especially proud of. Each projects ipynb file contains fleshed out explanations of my thought process, and the code. This list will evolve as I continue to learn and build more.

| Project                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  | Location                                      |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **LeNet-5 on MNIST (NumPy & PyTorch)**   | Implemented LeNet-5 entirely from scratch in NumPy, with manual forward & backward for convolutions, pooling, and dense layers. Later replicated in PyTorch to achieve ~99% on MNIST.        | [`CNN from Scratch with NumPy/`](./CNN_from_Scratch_with_NumPy)           |
| **Swin Transformer from Scratch (PyTorch)**   | Implemented the Shifted-window Transformer architecture, heavily modified for 64×64 Tiny ImageNet, with Relative Position Bias, Windowed Attention, stochastic depth, and CutMix / Mixup.        | [`Swin Transformer/`](./Swin_Transformer)           |
| **Single Shot Multibox Detection (SSD)**     | Built SSD end-to-end in PyTorch on Penn-Fudan: custom GT-centered cropping to replace RandomIoUCrop, ResNet-34 multi-scale backbone, anchor generation (7760/image), IoU matching, hard-negative mining, and NMS inference. | [`Single Shot Multibox Detection/`](./Single_Shot_Multibox_Detection) |
| **English–Japanese GRU Translator (NumPy)** | Encoder–decoder model built entirely in NumPy to translate short English sentences into Japanese. Manual GRU forward/backward, teacher forcing, gradient clipping, and backpropagation calculations written on paper.  | [`GRU Translator/`](./GRU_Encoder_Decoder_Numpy) |
| **Transformer English–Japanese Translator (PyTorch)** | Implemented full Transformer encoder–decoder model from scratch in PyTorch, including attention, positional encodings, masking, and a custom LR scheduler. Outputs generated via beam search. | [`Transformer Translator/`](./Transformer_Encoder-Decoder) |
