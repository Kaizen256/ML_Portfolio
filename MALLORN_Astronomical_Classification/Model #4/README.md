# Model 4: XGB SpecType

This notebook contains Model 4 for the MALLORN challenge.

This model is the first one that performed very well. It was enough to put me in around 130th / 925 participants on the public leaderboard. that success did not carry over to the final LB though.
The biggest change is using SpecType (train-only metadata) to generate features that can also be computed for the test set.

A Kaggle user in a discussion post said they had good results focusing on TDE vs SN/AGN which are values in SpecType. Since SpecType is not available at test time, I train a separate model to predict SpecType, and then use its predicted probabilities as additional features in the main TDE classifier.

1) Train a multiclass LightGBM model to predict `SpecTypeGroup`:
  - TDE
  - AGN
  - SNIa
  - SNother
  - Other

2) Generate OOF predicted probabilities for the train set:
  - Each training object only gets probabilities from a model that did not train on its group-split fold.

3) Fit the multiclass model on full train and predict probabilities for test.

4) Append these probabilities as features:
  - `p_spec_<class>` for each class
  - `spec_entropy` as a confidence / ambiguity signal

This gives the main classifier extra information about "what kind of transient this looks" like using only lightcurve-derived features.

| Submission | Public LB F1 | Private LB F1 |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | 0.6309 | 0.5688 |
| 2 | 0.6024 | 0.5333 |
| 3 | 0.6009 | 0.5467 |

At the time, the model seemed to generalize well. The first submission pushed me to around the top 200, and the follow-up submissions were all scoring above 0.6 F1. By the end of the competition, though, the results were more disappointing. The final leaderboard clearly contained harder examples than the public one, since most participants saw their F1 scores drop too. If I had stopped at this stage, I would have placed 178th, which is still respectable. Fortunately, this didn’t turn out to be my strongest model.

## Global features

These are computed using all observations across all bands for a given object.  
They summarize time coverage, brightness distribution, cadence, variability, and context (redshift + dust + redshift uncertainty).

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `n_obs` | Total number of observations across all filters | Captures overall sampling density and how well-measured the object is |
| `total_time_obs` | Observed-frame time baseline: `max(t_rel) - min(t_rel)` | Separates short transients vs long events and measures overall monitoring duration |
| `total_time_rest` | Rest-frame time baseline: `total_time_obs / (1+z)` | Removes time dilation so the model compares intrinsic evolution speed across redshifts |

### Flux distribution (dust-corrected `flux_corr`)

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `flux_mean` | Mean corrected flux | Measures average intrinsic brightness level (sensitive to sustained high flux) |
| `flux_median` | Median corrected flux | Robust typical brightness baseline (less sensitive to one-off spikes) |
| `flux_std` | Standard deviation of corrected flux | Captures variability strength (high = more change over time) |
| `flux_min` | Minimum corrected flux | Captures deep fades / dips / negative excursions from noise-subtraction artifacts |
| `flux_max` | Maximum corrected flux | Captures peak brightness or flare intensity (key transient signature) |
| `flux_mad` | Median absolute deviation of corrected flux | Robust variability estimate that doesn’t get bullied by outliers |
| `flux_iqr` | Interquartile range of corrected flux | Another robust variability measure (spread of the middle 50%) |
| `flux_skew` | Skewness of corrected flux distribution | Detects asymmetric lightcurves (fast rise / slow decay vs vice versa) |
| `flux_kurt_excess` | Excess kurtosis of corrected flux distribution | Detects heavy tails/spiky behavior from rare bursts or sharp transients |
| `flux_p5` | 5th percentile of corrected flux | Robust low-end level (less sensitive than min) |
| `flux_p25` | 25th percentile of corrected flux | Lower-quartile level |
| `flux_p75` | 75th percentile of corrected flux | Upper-quartile level |
| `flux_p95` | 95th percentile of corrected flux | Robust high-end level (less sensitive than max) |
| `robust_amp_global` | Robust amplitude: `flux_p95 - flux_p5` | Outlier-resistant variability scale, often better than max-min |
| `neg_flux_frac` | Fraction of corrected flux values `< 0` | Flags noise-dominated objects or weak detections where measurements hover around zero |

### SNR (using corrected errors `err_corr`)

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `snr_median` | Median SNR where `snr = \|flux_corr\| / (err_corr + EPS)` | Typical detection quality (separates clean signals from noisy junk) |
| `snr_max` | Maximum SNR | Captures the strongest detection event (some transients “light up” briefly) |

### Cadence / gaps

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `median_dt` | Median time gap between consecutive observations in `t_rel` | Describes typical cadence (important since sparse sampling hides shape) |
| `max_gap` | Maximum time gap between consecutive observations in `t_rel` | Detects missing windows (large gaps can explain unreliable peak/width estimates) |

### Time-series variability / shape

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `eta_von_neumann` | Von Neumann eta statistic on `flux_corr` (smoothness vs jumpiness) | Separates smooth evolving curves from noisy jitter or sudden jumps |
| `chi2_const_global` | Chi-square vs constant-flux model using `err_corr` | Quantifies variability relative to measurement noise (true variability vs noise) |
| `stetsonJ_global_obs` | Stetson J (consecutive-pairs) using observed-frame times | More cadence-aware correlation metric; reduces sensitivity to irregular sampling |
| `stetsonJ_global_rest` | Stetson J (consecutive-pairs) using rest-frame times | Same correlation idea, but corrected for time dilation |

### Slopes / rate of change (global)

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `max_slope_global_obs` | Maximum absolute slope in observed time (`t_rel`) | Captures fastest brightness change (sharp rise/fall events) |
| `max_slope_global_rest` | Maximum absolute slope in rest-frame time (`t_rest`) | Intrinsic fastest change rate (removes redshift stretching) |
| `med_abs_slope_global_obs` | Median absolute slope in observed time | Typical observed change rate (slow drifters vs active transients) |
| `med_abs_slope_global_rest` | Median absolute slope in rest-frame time | Typical intrinsic change rate |
| `slope_global_obs` | Best-fit linear slope over observed time | Captures long-term trend direction (rising vs fading overall) |
| `slope_global_rest` | Best-fit linear slope over rest-frame time | Same trend, but comparable across redshifts |

### Fractional variability

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `fvar_global` | Fractional variability accounting for measurement errors | Estimates intrinsic variability strength after subtracting noise contribution |

### Context metadata

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `Z` | Redshift `z` | Encodes distance/epoch effects and shifts events into different observed regimes |
| `log1pZ` | `log(1+z)` | Stabilizes redshift scaling for models (less extreme leverage at high `z`) |
| `Z_err` | Redshift uncertainty (clipped to `>= 0`) | Captures confidence in rest-frame correction; noisy redshifts degrade timing features |
| `log1pZerr` | `log(1+Z_err)` | Stabilizes uncertainty scaling and helps tree models split more smoothly |
| `EBV` | Dust reddening used for extinction correction | Helps the model learn residual dust systematics and measurement conditions |

### Filter coverage

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `n_filters_present` | Number of filters with ≥ 1 observation | Multi-band coverage gives richer color/shape info; missing bands can correlate with class |
| `total_obs` | Total observations summed across all filters (same as `n_obs`) | Redundant but convenient sanity/coverage signal that some models exploit |

## Per-filter (band-wise) features

For each band `b ∈ {u,g,r,i,z,y}`, the following features are computed independently per filter.  
This version adds **pre-peak baseline features** and richer **post-peak decay morphology**.

### Post-peak fall times, widths, and sharpness (only if `amp_pre_{b} > 0`)

These use `baseline_pre_{b}` and `amp_pre_{b}` to define levels as fractions of the peak amplitude.

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `t_fall50_{b}_obs` | Observed-frame time after peak to reach `baseline_pre + 0.50 * amp_pre` | Encodes decay speed in observed time (fast vs slow fall) |

| `auc_pos_{b}_obs` | Observed-frame AUC above `baseline_pre`: `∫ max(fb - baseline_pre, 0) dt` | Energy-like summary tied to true baseline, not median-biased |
| `auc_pos_{b}_rest` | Rest-frame AUC above `baseline_pre` | Comparable across redshifts; strong spectral-energy cue |

### Peak structure and post-peak behavior (only if `amp_pre_{b} > 0`)

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `peak_dominance_{b}` | `amp_pre / (mad_pre + EPS)` where `mad_pre` is pre-peak baseline MAD | Measures how dominant the peak is relative to baseline noise (real transients pop out) |
| `std_ratio_prepost_{b}` | `std(pre_seg) / (std(post_seg) + EPS)` | Captures how variability changes after peak (e.g., noisy baseline vs smooth decay) |

| `n_rebrighten_{b}` | Count of rebrightening events after peak (relative to `amp_pre`) | Strong discriminator: rebrightening often means non-simple transient behavior |

### Decay power-law fit (post-peak, only if `amp_pre_{b} > 0`)

A power-law fit is attempted on the post-peak decay segment (up to a max time window).

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |

| `tpeak_std_rest` | Standard deviation of `tpeak_b_rest` across bands with peaks | Intrinsic chromatic peak spread (less redshift-biased) |

## Cross-band pair features (adjacent pairs: `ug, gr, ri, iz, zy`)

For each adjacent filter pair `(a,b)`, these compare peak timing and peak flux ratios across wavelengths.

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `tpeakdiff_{a}{b}_obs` | Observed-frame peak time difference: `tpeak_a_obs - tpeak_b_obs` | Chromatic peak lag/lead in observed time (includes cadence + dilation effects) |
| `tpeakdiff_{a}{b}_rest` | Rest-frame peak time difference: `tpeak_a_rest - tpeak_b_rest` | Intrinsic chromatic lag/lead; strong class signature (blue earlier than red, etc.) |
| `peakratio_{a}{b}` | Peak flux ratio: `peak_flux_a / (peak_flux_b + EPS)` | Strong color/SED proxy without needing explicit magnitudes |

## Color features at r-peak (observed-frame) + 20/40-day evolution

These interpolate `g`, `r`, `i` flux at the observed time when the r-band peaks (`tpeak_r_obs`), then compute log-flux colors.  
They also sample the same colors at `+20` and `+40` days to capture cooling/heating trends.

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |

| `color_gr_rpeak_p40_obs` | g-r color at `tpeak_r_obs + 40` days | Captures longer-term cooling/heating behavior |
| `color_ri_rpeak_p40_obs` | r-i color at `tpeak_r_obs + 40` days | Longer-term evolution in redder bands |
| `color_gr_slope20_obs` | `(color_gr(+20) - color_gr(0)) / 20` | Rate of color change over 20 days (cooling slope) |
| `color_ri_slope20_obs` | `(color_ri(+20) - color_ri(0)) / 20` | Rate of red color change over 20 days |
| `color_gr_slope40_obs` | `(color_gr(+40) - color_gr(0)) / 40` | Rate of color change over 40 days (more stable, less noisy) |
| `color_ri_slope40_obs` | `(color_ri(+40) - color_ri(0)) / 40` | Rate of red color change over 40 days |

## SpecType teacher stacking features (high-level)

`add_spectype_teacher_features()` adds *legal stacking* features by training a multiclass model on **train only** to predict a grouped version of `SpecType`, then appending the predicted class probabilities as new features.

Key steps:
- Map `SpecType` → `SpecTypeGroup` (TDE, AGN, SNIa, SNother, Other)
- Train a LightGBM multiclass model using CV splits by `split`
- Create:
  - OOF probabilities for train
  - full-fit probabilities for test
- Append probabilities + entropy as new features

### Per-class probability features

For every group label `c` in `classes`:

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `p_spec_{c}` | Predicted probability the object belongs to SpecTypeGroup `c` | Injects a strong “soft label” summary of transient type, which improves the final binary classifier |

### Probability-uncertainty feature

| Feature | Meaning | Why it helps |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `spec_entropy` | Entropy of the teacher probability vector | High entropy = teacher unsure (ambiguous object); low entropy = confident type signal (more reliable stacking) |

### Teacher Model

A LGBM Classifier is trained to predict `SpecTypeGroup` using the full feature set.

To prevent leakage:

- GroupKFold is used by split group
- Teacher predictions are generated out-of-fold
- Only OOF teacher probabilities are used as student features

### Student Model

The final classifier is trained to predict the competition target using:

- all base lightcurve/statistical features
- teacher OOF probability features
- teacher confidence and entropy features
